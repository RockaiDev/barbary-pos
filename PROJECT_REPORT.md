# Warta POS System - Project Report

## What We Built
We developed a complete restaurant management system that handles both in-store orders and online orders. The system manages customers, tracks loyalty points, creates invoices, and provides detailed reports.

## Main Features We Implemented

### 1. Order Management
- **Cashier Orders**: Staff can create orders directly at the counter
- **Web Orders**: Online orders automatically appear in the system
- **Unified Processing**: Both types of orders are handled the same way

### 2. Customer Management
- **Customer Database**: Store customer information and delivery addresses
- **Loyalty Points**: Customers earn points with each order
- **Point Redemption**: Customers can use points for discounts
- **Order History**: Track all customer orders

### 3. Invoice System
- **Automatic Creation**: Invoices are created automatically from orders
- **Separate Tracking**: Different numbering for cashier and web orders
- **Printing**: Invoices can be printed for customers
- **Management**: View, edit, and delete invoices

### 4. Real-time Updates
- **Live Notifications**: New online orders appear immediately
- **Instant Updates**: All changes are reflected in real-time
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor order status and progress

## Problems We Solved

### 1. Data Inconsistency
**Problem**: Online orders came in different formats, making them hard to process
**Solution**: Created a system that handles all data formats and converts them to a standard format

### 2. Order Confusion
**Problem**: Cashier and web orders were getting mixed up
**Solution**: Separated the two types and gave them different tracking numbers

### 3. Points System Issues
**Problem**: Customer loyalty points weren't calculating correctly
**Solution**: Fixed the calculation system and made sure points are updated properly

### 4. Price Display Problems
**Problem**: Prices from online orders weren't showing correctly
**Solution**: Fixed the price conversion and display system

### 5. Invoice Numbering
**Problem**: All web orders were getting the same invoice number
**Solution**: Created separate counters for different order types
